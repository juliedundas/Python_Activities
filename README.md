# Python_Activities
I have created this repository to include various applications that I created with Python in an effort to keep my Python skills honed.

# First Activity:
- Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Instructions

* Using the terminal, take an input of `r`, `p` or `s` which will stand for rock, paper, and scissors.

* Have the computer randomly pick one of these three choices.

* Compare the user's input to the computer's choice to determine if the user won, lost, or tied.

# Second Activity:
- Read Netflix

## Instructions

* Prompt the user for what video they are looking for.

* Search through the `netflix_ratings.csv` to find the user's video.

* If the CSV contains the user's video then print out the title, what it is rated and the current user ratings.

  * For example "Pup Star is rated G with a rating of 82"

* If the CSV does not contain the user's video then print out a message telling them that their video could not be found.
